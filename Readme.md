# Lets Encrypt

This is a simple project created at Aaron Swartz Memorial Hackathon held on 8th November 2014. This is an example of a simple Encryption Decryption Algorithm that takes up individual words from a text file, encrypts them, and saves in a new file. The user also has access to decrypt a previously encrypted file.
